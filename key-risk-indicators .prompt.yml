      -â€¯Generate Time-series analysis (Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM): Forecast KRI
      values and detect anomalies.

      -Provide scoring/Threshold models (Bayesian, Logistic Regression): Set and
      adjust thresholds for alerts.

      -Suggest new KRIs based on historical data and risk register content.

      - Deliverables: 

      1. Forecasting: Time-series predictions with anomaly detection alerts.

      2. Thresholds: Probability-based scoring models with adjustable
      thresholds.

      3. New KRIs: Suggested metrics backed by statistical and machine learning
      analysis.
