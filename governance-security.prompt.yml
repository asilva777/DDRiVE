      - Access control models (RBAC, ABAC frameworks): Implemented as
      algorithmic logic rather than AI, but can be enhanced with anomaly
      detection models (Isolation Forest, AutoEncoder) to flag unusual
      permission changes or access.

      - Document classifier (BERT, GPT-4): For ensuring documents are tagged
      with correct sensitivity/confidentiality levels.

      - Provide breakdown on workflow automation, compliance monitoring, and
      ensuring data integrity with AI as well.

      - Deep dive on Intelligent Task Routing; NLP-based Process Automation; and
      Predictive Process Optimization

      -Augments traditional security/compliance by making automation more
      adaptive (via intelligent routing) and proactive (through predictive
      analytics), while using NLP to “understand” context and content—thus
      reducing manual effort, error, and risk.
