      - Conduct semantic similarity search between user controls and framework
      requirements (ISOâ€¯31000, COSO, etc.).

      - Generate control recommendations and mapping narrative controls to
      framework clauses.

      -Visualize control relationships, dependencies, and mappings.

      - Generate applied examples, code samples,  and suggestions for specific
      frameworks/tools

      - Integrate the above with your control repository/workflow tool for live
      recommendations.

      - Expand by automatically pulling framework text from APIs or PDFs.

      - Consider building a dashboard in Dash or Streamlit to automate the full
      flow (input controls, run semantic mapping, fetch code samples, visualize,
      and recommend).

      -  Provide detailed code for a specific step, and further detail on
      integrating with a particular framework (e.g., ISO 31000, COSO)
