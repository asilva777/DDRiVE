# DDRiVE – Data Driven Risk and Vulnerability Evaluation and Management

**DDRiVE** is a modern Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for comprehensive risk and vulnerability management across multiple domains. It allows organizations to establish a centralized platform for risk registers, controls, treatments, data governance, and more — fully aligned with global standards like ISO 31000, CPS 230, COSO, and SOX.

## 🔧 Features

- 📋 **Digital Risk Register**  
  Create unlimited risk categories (Operational, IT, Cyber, Supplier, Regulatory, Environmental, Geohazard, etc.).

- 🧱 **Comprehensive Control Framework**  
  Build a centralized control library with testing schedules and bow-tie analysis.

- 🛡️ **Mitigating Actions & Treatments**  
  Compare risk levels against thresholds and manage treatments accordingly.

- 🔐 **Data Governance & Permissions**  
  Enforce hierarchical visibility and streamline approval workflows.

- 📊 **Dashboards & Bow-Tie Visualizations**  
  See a "Quick View" dashboard and detailed bow-tie risk relationships.

- 📈 **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**  
  Use KRIs and quantitative analysis to monitor and validate risks.

- 🔄 **Link Risk to GRC Processes**  
  Map risks to incidents, audit findings, strategic objectives, and compliance mandates.
